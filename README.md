# üìä Machine Learning Tasks ‚Äì DevelopersHub
This repository contains multiple data analysis and machine learning projects demonstrating end-to-end workflows ‚Äî from loading datasets, exploring data, preprocessing, model building, to evaluation and visualization.

## üìÅ Projects Included

### Task 1 : Iris Dataset Classification
Goal: Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on flower measurements.
Dataset:
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository, Iris
Records: 150 samples
Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
Target: Flower species (3 classes)
Workflow:
Data loading & exploration ‚Äì Viewed dataset structure, statistics, and first few rows.
Visualization : Plots showing feature distribution, pairwise relationships, and species separation.
Model training : Applied classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree).
Evaluation ‚Äì Checked accuracy and compared results across models.
Key Insights from Plots:
Petal length and petal width are strong separators for Setosa vs other species.
Some overlap exists between Versicolor and Virginica.
Result:
Achieved high accuracy (above 95%) in classifying the flowers.

### Task 2 : Customer Segmentation
Goal: Segment mall customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
Dataset:
Source: Mall Customer Dataset
Records: 200 customers
Features: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score
Target: Not predefined (unsupervised learning)
Workflow:
Data inspection : Checked dataset shape, feature types, and missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äì Plotted distributions of age, income, and spending score; visualized relationships between variables.
Clustering : Applied K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to group customers.
Model tuning : Used the Elbow method and Silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualization : 2D scatter plots showing customer clusters and their distribution in income‚Äìspending score space.
Key Insights from Plots:
Clear segmentation observed between high-spending and low-spending customers.
DBSCAN helped identify noise/outlier points not belonging to main groups.
Result:
Identified meaningful customer groups to assist in targeted marketing strategies.

### Task 3 ‚Äì Heart Disease Prediction
Goal: Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and demographic data.
Dataset:
Records: 920 patients
Features: Age, Sex, Chest pain type, Blood pressure, Cholesterol, Max heart rate, etc.
Target: 0 for No heart disease, 1 for Heart disease present
Workflow:
Data inspection ‚Äì Checked shape, missing values, and data types.
Preprocessing ‚Äì Filled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äì Visualized target distribution, feature relationships, and correlations.
Model training ‚Äì Used Logistic Regression for binary classification.
Evaluation ‚Äì Measured accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and plotted confusion matrix.
Key Insights from Plots:
Target distribution is fairly balanced.
Certain features (e.g., chest pain type, max heart rate) show clear patterns between classes.
Confusion matrix confirms balanced model performance.
Results:
Accuracy: 88.5%
Precision & Recall: 0.88‚Äì0.89 for both classes.
The model generalizes well for both positive and negative predictions.
